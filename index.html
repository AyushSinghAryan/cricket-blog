            <h2>My Stadium experience of World Cup 2023</h2>
            <p>I watched the India vs England live match in Lucknow. The fully packed stadium, and the noise of buzz,
                whistles,
                and
                light shows are just unbelievable. India vs England was my first international 50-over match experience
                that
                I
                watched
                in the stadium. When the national anthem played in the stadium all 50 thousand people stood up and sang
                the
                national
                anthem This was a goosebumps moment.</p>

            <p>
                India started slow but with Rohit Sharma's master-class batting India
                gave
                a 230
                score to England. Then in the second innings, Mohammed Shami and Bumarah's master class bowled out
                England
                under
                129 and
                the light show added the cherry on the cake.</p>

            <h2>World Cup 2023</h2>

            <p>The 2023 World Cup is being hosted in India, and India is considered the favorite to win because of the
                trend
                of
                the
                home team winning the 50-over World Cup. </p>

                height="200">
            <p>

                However, India only lost one match in the 2023 World Cup, in the
                final
                against
                Australia. During the final game, India could not defend 240 runs, leading to heartbreak for fans
                worldwide.

            <h2>T20 World Cup 2024 Blessing in disguise </h2>

            <p>This is the first time that India has not started the World Cup as favorites. India began their World Cup
                campaign in
                New York where the pitches were not good, after qualifying for the Super 8, India went to West Indies
                where
                they played
                the semi-final against England, and the final against South Africa .</p>

            <p>Most people do not believe how India defended 28 of 29, but master class Bumrah, Hardik, and Arshdeep
                Singh
                successfully
                defended the run and India lifted the T20 World Cup after 17 years, this also the end of the t20 career
                of
                the two
                giants of the game Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.</p>
